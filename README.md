## About The Project

I have created a website on a writer named, Muhammed Zafar Iqbal. In this project, I have implemented a login registration system where any user can try to register with email and password, register with google popup, login, do a password reset etc. I have created header, footer, and components such as About, Awards, Banner, Blogs, Services, etc. I have used react router to create navigation bar, set route, protected route, etc. For look and style, I used tailwind css framework, tailwind-elements and some custom css.
